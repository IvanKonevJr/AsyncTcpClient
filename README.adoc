# Async Tcp Client

A universal asynchronous client for a TCP cluster that provides a strict sequence of sent packets, i.e. the next packet leaves only after receiving a response from the previous one.

If no response to the previous packet is received, then after 5 seconds the previous packet is resent without changes.

Add the Maven dependency:
